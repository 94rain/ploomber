    # for some reason, read the docs command to install the package fails due to
    # a version mismatch (it uses the setup.py file directly instead of pip),
    # adding this to fix it - we are now using the readthedocs.yaml for config
    # (as opposed to the website) which lets us install using pip-
    # this might no longer be necessary
