Roadmap
=======

These are some of the features that we have in the pipeline. If you have any feedback, `open an issue <https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber/issues/new?title=Roadmap>`_ or send us a message on `Slack <http://community.ploomber.io>`_.

- Improve code difference detection (i.e., detect when an imported function changes).
- Better feedback in Jupyter when failing to load the pipeline (we only display feedback to the Jupyter console).
- Building online APIs from pipelines with scripts/notebooks (we only support exporting online APIs from pipelines with Python functions).
- Better support for non-Jupyter editors like VSCode or PyCharm (the cell injection process only works on Jupyter).

Ideas
*****

These are some ideas we have if you want us to work on it, `open an issue <https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber/issues/new?title=Roadmap>`_ or send us a message on `Slack <http://community.ploomber.io>`_.

- A frontend Jupyter plug-in (e.g., to visualize execution status in real-time).
- Autocompletion and linting in Jupyter when editing ``pipeline.yaml``.
- Automated pipeline testing.
- Expand integration with Google Cloud (we only support uploading to Cloud Storage).
- Expand integration with AWS (we only support S3 and AWS Batch).
- Integration with Azure Machine Learning services.
- Support for Julia.
